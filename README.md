The following are suggested commands for installing new software - there is no need to install software you already have (e.g., typically Chrome is already installed). You can find additional information by going to the specific link from <https://chocolatey.org/packages>.

```Powershell

The default location is generally something like 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey' or for earlier installations, 'c:\chocolatey'.

## Upgrade All

To upgrade your versions, periodically run choco upgrade.

```Powershell
choco upgrade chocolatey -y
choco upgrade all
```
